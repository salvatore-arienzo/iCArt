## iCArt - Project for Apple Foundation Program @ Unisa, Winter 2019

iCArt is a Swift application developed during the Apple Foundation Program held in the University of Salerno during Winter 2019. The goal of this application is to help blind or visual impaired people to enjoy their museal experience using available technologies like their smartphone and IoT devices such as Beacons.

The application is designed to be completely usable for blind people. Every information on the screen is described by a text-to-speech and all the features are reachable using gestures, like tap and swipe. When the application is started by tapping on the screen, a short on boarding, explaning all the features and usage, is held.

Then, the research of all nearby beacon devices is started, and when the user, walking, is enough close to a painting, he receives an aptic feedback and some information about that painting.
